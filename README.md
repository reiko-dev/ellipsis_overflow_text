## Usage

`EllipsisOverflowText` behaves exactly like a `Text`. The only difference is that it automatically sets the number of lines to be shown on a text with the ellipsis overflow type.

```dart
EllipsisOverflowText(
  'Some text here',
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `data`* | The String text to be shown. |
| `key`* | Controls how one widget replaces another widget in the tree. |
| `textKey` | The inner Text Widget key. |
| `locale`* |  Used to select a font when the same Unicode character can be rendered differently, depending on the locale. |
| `maxLines` |  An optional maximum number of lines for the text to span. |
| `semanticsLabel`* | An alternative semantics label for this text. |
| `selectionColor`* | The color to use when painting the selection. |
| `softWrap`* | Whether the text should break at soft line breaks. |
| `strutStyle`* | Defines the strut, which sets the minimum height a line can be relative to the baseline. |
| `style`* | If non-null, the style to use for this text |
| `textAlign`* | How the text should be aligned horizontally. |
| `textDirection`* | The directionality of the text. This decides how `textAlign` values like `TextAlign.start` and `TextAlign.end` are interpreted. |
| `textHeightBehavior`* | Defines how to apply [TextStyle.height] over and under text. |
| `textScaleFactor`* | The number of font pixels for each logical pixel. |
| `textWidthBasis`* | The different ways of measuring the width of one or more lines of text. |

Parameters marked with \* behave exactly the same as in `Text`


## Performance

`EllipsisOverflowText` is really fast. In fact, you can replace all your `Text` widgets with `EllipsisOverflowText`.<br>

## Troubleshooting

### Missing bounds

If `EllipsisOverflowText` overflows or does not replace the text with ellipsis characters, you should check if it has constrained width and height.

**Wrong** code:
```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    EllipsisOverflowText(
      'Here is a very long text, which will use ellipsis in case the text overflows',
    ),
  ],
)
```
Because `Row` and other widgets like `Container`, `Column` or `ListView` do not constrain their children, the text will overflow.  
You can fix this by constraining the `EllipsisOverflowText`. Wrap it with `Expanded` in case of `Row` and `Column` or use a `SizedBox` or another widget with fixed width (and height).

**Correct** code:
```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded( // Constrains EllipsisOverflowText to the width of the Row (You could use Flexible instead).
      child: EllipsisOverflowText(
        'Here is a very long text, which will use ellipsis in case the text overflows',
      )
    ),
  ],
)
}
```

Further explanation can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53908204), the question is about the AutoSizeText package, but the answer is the same for this package.</b>
